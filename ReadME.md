Here's how you can run and test the application:
Run the Application Locally

Navigate to your project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to start Laravel's built-in server:
Copy code
`php artisan serve`
This will start the server, usually accessible at http://localhost:8000.


Test the Application Manually

Open a web browser and navigate to the URL where you've set up your transaction form, e.g., http://localhost:8000/transaction.
Fill in the details for each transaction type (Cash, Credit Card, Bank Transfer) and submit the form.
Ensure that the validation rules are applied correctly (e.g., card numbers starting with '4', valid expiration dates, etc.).
Check the success or error messages after form submission.
Verify that the transaction details are correctly stored in the database.

If you run into errors or unexpected behavior, Laravel provides detailed error messages that will help you understand what's going wrong.
For database issues, consider using tools like Laravel Telescope or debugging tools in IDEs like PHPStorm.
Laravel's log (storage/logs/laravel.log) can also provide insights into any errors or issues.
